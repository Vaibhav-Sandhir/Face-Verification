# Face Verification Project

## Introduction

This project implements a face verification system using a Siamese neural network architecture. The Siamese network is particularly well-suited for face verification tasks as it can learn to distinguish between pairs of faces, determining whether they belong to the same person or different individuals.

## Technologies Used

### Siamese Neural Network

The core of our face verification system is built upon a Siamese neural network. This architecture consists of two identical subnetworks that process two input images simultaneously. The network learns to generate embeddings for each input face, allowing for efficient comparison and verification.

### MongoDB Database

To store and manage user data efficiently, we've integrated MongoDB as our database solution. MongoDB's flexible document model allows us to store complex user information, including facial features and metadata, in a scalable and easily queryable format.

### Streamlit User Interface

For a seamless user experience, we've developed a user interface using Streamlit. This powerful Python library enables us to create an interactive and responsive web application for our face verification system. Users can easily upload images, perform verifications, and view results through this intuitive interface.
